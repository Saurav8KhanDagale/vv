In writing, students begin by learning letters, then words, and finally sentences. In time, students learn how to write a paragraph by taking those sentences and organizing them around a common topic. Learning how to write a paragraph can be challenging since it requires knowing how to write a great topic sentence, using supporting details and transitional words, as well as finding a strong concluding sentence.  In fiction, writing a paragraph means understanding which ideas go together and where a new paragraph should begin.
